# jsm2016slides
Beamer slides from the JSM 2016 [SRMS SPEED session](https://www.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2016/onlineprogram/ActivityDetails.cfm?SessionID=213155) by Stas Kolenikov, Abt SRBI

The files are provided as an example of 

1. how to prepare a SPEED poster for JSM;
2. how to develop your own color scheme. [Black and blue and white](https://www.hartwork.org/beamer-theme-matrix/all/beamer-default-default-0.png)? Argh. Ew. Barf. I implore you to have some respect for the organization that spends its money on you. (If I were your Dean, I would not send you next time. For real. I am that much of a stickler badass.) Check with your organization what your color scheme is supposed to be. Get and scale the logo; get the RGB colors of the design that your organization/university uses, and incorporate them.

This files *will not* compile. Reasons:

1. The `beamerposter` has always been compiling with errors on my end. I could never fix them. The end product looked OK to me though.
2. You may have problems with the logo and/or bibliography. With all due respect, I am not going to install mikTeX on a clean machine just to check if this stuff checks.

Good luck.
